Code is a blueprint.  
Data is the foundation.  
I build systems that help explain the world — models, maps, and frameworks that turn uncertainty into the workable.
My projects include mortality risk mapping, language modeling, and tools for making complex systems easier to understand and work with.  
This space holds the tools, drafts, and structures I’m building next.
