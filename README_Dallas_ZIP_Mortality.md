This project models synthetic mortality risk across Dallas-area ZIP codes using demographic predictors from the American Community Survey. Due to privacy constraints on granular death counts, ZIP-level risk is inferred from county-level mortality rates, adjusted for age, income, education, and race. The resulting scores highlight spatial disparities and identify neighborhoods with elevated risk exposure. Data is visualized via a choropleth map using GeoPandas, enabling clear geographic insight into public health vulnerability. This analysis can support resource allocation, outreach prioritization, or further modeling by city or nonprofit stakeholders.

# Dallas County ZIP-Level Mortality Estimates (2011–2022)

This dataset and codebase estimates yearly death counts and death rates at the ZIP code level for Dallas County, Texas, based on population-adjusted scaling of official county-wide death totals.

## 📊 Datasets Used

1. **Dallas County Yearly Death Totals (2011–2022)**
   - Source: Texas Health and Human Services
   - Contains annual total deaths in Dallas County
   - Used as the baseline for estimating deaths per ZIP code

2. **ZIP-Level Demographics (2022)**
   - Source: U.S. Census Bureau – ACS 5-Year Estimates via Census API
   - Variables: total population, median income, education, age 65+, race/ethnicity
   - Data reflects a rolling average from **2018–2022**
   - Limited to ZIP codes that fall within Dallas County

## ⚠️ Data Disclaimer

Demographic variables in this dataset are based on the **2022 ACS 5-Year Estimates**, which represent average conditions from **2018 to 2022**. Therefore:

- **Demographics are static** across all modeled years (2011–2022)
- They are not intended to represent specific year-to-year changes

## 📁 Output File

- `zip_yearly_death_estimates.csv`: Contains estimated yearly deaths, death rate per 1,000 residents, and demographics per ZIP code

## 🔧 Methodology

- Deaths were allocated to ZIP codes proportionally based on their share of the total Dallas County population
- Each ZIP/year entry includes death estimates and static demographic characteristics
